# LeNeT5_implementation_using_PyTorch

A pytorch implementation of the LeNeT CNN Architecture proposed by Yann LeCun in November 1998. A few modifications are made in terms of pooling and activation function. 

# Dataset
Take a look at the preview of the dataset.

# Predictions
Now, look at the predictions of the model. The results are really great for a model architecture proposed in 1998.
